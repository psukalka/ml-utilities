# ML Utilities
Initially this repository will hold code snippets that I learn in AI-ML course. 
As my knowledge evolves, it might store other ML related utilities.

## Running script
python -m scripts.data_preprocessing

## Notes:
- Feature scaling shouldn't be applied on dummy variables (ex. one-hot encoded values) as they are already either 0 or 1 and would lose their meaning by scaling
